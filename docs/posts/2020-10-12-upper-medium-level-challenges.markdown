#### Upper-medium level challenges will introduce you to general Kubernetes scaling principles. It is one of the DevOps key moments to have your applications scalable and flexible under the load. You will continue using Azure Kubernetes environment in this step. Please youse your free Azure credit wisely, wrong configuration for autoscaling can spend it quickly. While completing these tasks, you will get to know what a Pod autoscaler is and how to configure a Deployment for it. Knowledge gained during this level challenges completion will improve your understanding on DevOps principles and help with next challenge tiers. You can submit as many proofs of completion as you have achieved after completing this tier. Good luck!

#### Challenge instructions:

- Use an existing Azure Kubernetes cluster

- Make sure it is running and webpage is displayed when navigating to Service IP address

- Configure a Horizontal Pod automatic scaling for your Kubernetes cluster (containing your team's name)

- Use pod limits. It is recomended to not exceed **500 microcpus** and use maximum allowed number of pods **4**. But you are free to experiment with different values. Remember to not spend all the Azure credit ðŸ˜€

- Deploy a [FoldingAtHome](https://foldingathome.org/) image instead of a  previous webpage image

- ```Note: FoldingAtHome allows you to change identity and use some team name. It is up to you if you want to use your team name for folding. But it could be a good added fun factor to see to overall folding score per team in the end!```

- Make sure Deployment name containins your team's name

- Image repository reference is ```ghcr.io/linuxserver/foldingathome```

- Open the application by going to your Service URL

- You can controll a load now or disable it from the FoldingAtHome interface

- Resize the load and see how your Pods scale up and down

- Submit a proof of completion

#### Proof of completion:

See the steps below and fill a form based on them

- Execute terminal command ```kubectl get all```. Provide a screenshot containing command and it's output.

- Provide a configuration file for **Deployment** in ```.yaml``` or ```.yml``` format.

- Provide a screenshot containing browser window with your FoldingAtHome application open. The entire window ðŸ™‚

- Execute terminal command ```kubectl get hpa``` **without** load generated by FoldingAtHome. Provide a screenshot containing command and it's output.

- ```Note: Make sure command output contains your teams name```

- Execute terminal command ```kubectl get hpa``` **with** load generated by FoldingAtHome. Provide a screenshot containing command and it's output.

- ```Note: Make sure command output contains your teams name```

- Provide a URL for your FoldingAtHome application

- ```Note: remember to stop the load generation to avoid spending all the credit```

- Send a message in the Slack challenges channel that Tier 3 URL is submitted

#### [Please submit your proofs of completion here. Should be done once after each challenges tier.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf53aLceF3jVJ23gJ8kGVN_rOZ6uB4IiWHa62O79IyeiHpXMQ/viewform?usp=sf_link){:target="_blank"}
