### **Metatavu presents**
# **a DevOps challenge**


This challenge (well, it’s more like a set of challenges) is a hackathon-like experience where students work in small teams to explore and learn modern devops technologies and compete in solving some wicked challenges we’ve prepared for you.

DevOps is an approach to software development, hosting, and infrastructure management that combines operations and development, thus the name dev and ops. The approach and the underlying philosophy is well established and provides agility and speed in contrast to traditional siloed approach to software development and separate infrastructure and management. 

However, devops needs know-how and understanding of modern infrastructure, technologies, best practices, and mindset. Most software companies and even established enterprises are looking for devops talents. 

Now you have the perfect opportunity to learn and try out Azure, Kubernetes, and other devops tools and methods. Oh, and there will be prizes for those brave who will survive the challenges.

<!-- You will find challenges and any supporting information on this Github Pages website or under the [XAMK challenges GitHub repository](https://github.com/Metatavu/xamk-challenges). -->

## **Registration**
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The event is free but requires a registration. You can register as a small team (2-3 people) or as an individual. We’ll try to do some matchmaking if you’d like to be a part of a team but don’t have one. However, we cannot conjure up team members.

The registration ends on Thursday 12.11.2020 at midnight.

## **Challenges**


The challenges will be revealed on Monday 16.11 at 16.00. They will focus on devops, Azure, and Kubernetes. Stay tuned.

There will be four tiers ranging from easy to very challenging. Each tier builds on top of the previous. Teams can continue developing their work and see how far they can get.

Working on the challenges requires basic programming skills, some knowledge of Azure services (e.g. databases, Kubernetes), and understanding on how to deploy software on it. However, the most important requirement is a curious mindset and the ability to learn and experiment.
